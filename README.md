I, Yakvi, will participate to the next Devember. My Devember will be writing my own clangformat-style C++ formatter. I promise I will program for my Devember for at least an hour, every day of the next December (starting Dec 4). I will also write a daily public devlog and will make the produced code publicly available on the internet. No matter what, I will keep my promise. 

I am a disciple of Handmade Manifesto but I suck at low-level programming. With this project, I hope to increase my knowledge of C/C++ coding, as well as write a useful tool for my Handmade Hero lessons. I might be using the following libraries: 

 * C STD library
 * Sean Barrett's STB library

But, first of all, I will try to code everything myself. 

I will be using Handmade Hero's first Days and Asset Packer Days for kick off, but only use it as a reference for writing my own code. My tools are Visual Studio Code and VS2017 Community edition compiler. 

The final product aims to have following features: 
 * A one-hotkey tool to reformat passed filename or
 * If filename is not passed, all files in the directory the program is located at will be formatted.
 * A config file which would aim to replicate clang-format's functionality, at least in a limited fashion.
 * A space to write own custom rules using regular expressions or similar. 

But, first of all, I will try to learn some autonomous C++ programming. In 200+ days of Handmade Hero, I've never had courage to start my own project (and to bring it some sort of conclusion). 

This is my #devember.
